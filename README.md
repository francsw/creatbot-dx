Creatbot DX configs for klipper


I got Klipper to work on a Createbot DX. 
It has a v9.1.1 motherboard, which is almost the same as the 9.2.3 one.

I've made some updates to the printer.cfg file.
Here's a summary:
- Got the pin to turn the printer off via interface
- Changed microsteps to try and make the stepper artifacts better
- Configured input shaping
- Configured filament sensors

This isn't a stock standard DX, so be sure to check the README
